# TrainTime

This app will store train schedules in Firebase and recall them for the user anywhere in the world.
The next arrrival time is determined by using the first stop time, the frequency of the stops, and the user's current time.
The minutes away then uses the arrival time and the user's current time to determine how many minutes are left.
